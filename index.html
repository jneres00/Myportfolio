                <h1>Hi, I'm Jessica</h1>
                <p class="about-text">
                    I’m a Graphic Design student from Brazil with a genuine passion for learning and improving a little more every day. I currently study at Uninter University and work with tools like Canva, Adobe Illustrator, and Figma to create visual solutions that are beautiful, functional, and meaningful.
                </p>
                <p class="about-text">
                    In addition to design, I’ve been developing my skills in social media, including content creation, visual storytelling, and basic video editing using CapCut. I enjoy creating layouts, experimenting with styles, and crafting designs that communicate clearly and connect with audiences.
                </p>
                <p class="about-text">
                    I also have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which I occasionally use in small personal projects — mostly to explore simple visual or interactive ideas.
                </p>
                <p class="about-text">
                    Beyond design, I study English, French, and Spanish independently because I believe that understanding other cultures expands creativity. I’m building my path with patience, curiosity, and a strong desire to create work that truly makes a difference.
